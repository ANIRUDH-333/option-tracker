# Filter by order type
settings.copy_market_orders = True

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Add Follower Accounts to .env

```bash
# Your existing master account stays unchanged
API_KEY=your_master_api_key
CLIENT_ID=your_master_client_id
PASSWORD=your_master_password
TOTP_SECRET=your_master_totp_secret
SECRET_KEY=your_master_secret_key

# Add follower accounts
FOLLOWER_1_API_KEY=follower1_api_key
FOLLOWER_1_CLIENT_ID=follower1_client_id
FOLLOWER_1_PASSWORD=follower1_password
FOLLOWER_1_TOTP_SECRET=follower1_totp_secret
FOLLOWER_1_SECRET_KEY=follower1_secret_key

# Add more as needed (FOLLOWER_2_, FOLLOWER_3_, etc.)
```

### 2. Validate Setup

```bash
python validate_setup.py
```

Should show ✅ for all checks once follower accounts are added.

### 3. Run Unit Tests

```bash
cd tests
python test_multi_account_copy_trading.py
```

All tests should pass.

### 4. Start in Dry Run Mode (Safe Testing)

```bash
python run_multi_account_copy_trading.py
```

This will:
- Initialize all accounts
- Monitor master for orders
- Show what would be copied
- **NOT place any orders** (dry run)

### 5. Test with Real Order

Place a test order in your master account and watch:
```
🔔 🔔 🔔 NEW ORDER DETECTED 🔔 🔔 🔔

📊 Master Account Order Details:
   Symbol: NIFTY23FEB18000CE
   Type: BUY MARKET
   Quantity: 50
   
🔍 DRY RUN MODE: Would copy to 2 followers
```

### 6. Enable Live Trading (After Testing)

Edit `run_multi_account_copy_trading.py`:
```python
settings.dry_run = False  # Change from True to False
```

Run again and confirm when prompted.
