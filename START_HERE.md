## 🚀 Getting Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Add Follower Accounts (2 minutes)

Edit your `.env` file and add:

```bash
# Your existing master account (don't change)
API_KEY=your_master_api_key
CLIENT_ID=your_master_client_id
PASSWORD=your_master_password
TOTP_SECRET=your_master_totp_secret
SECRET_KEY=your_master_secret_key

# ADD THESE - Follower Account 1
FOLLOWER_1_API_KEY=follower1_api_key
FOLLOWER_1_CLIENT_ID=follower1_client_id
FOLLOWER_1_PASSWORD=follower1_password
FOLLOWER_1_TOTP_SECRET=follower1_totp_secret
FOLLOWER_1_SECRET_KEY=follower1_secret_key

# Add more followers as needed (FOLLOWER_2_, FOLLOWER_3_, ...)
```

### Step 2: Validate Setup (1 minute)

```bash
python validate_setup.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ .env file exists
✅ Master account configured
✅ Follower accounts configured
✅ All dependencies installed
✅ All files present
✅ Configuration valid
🎉 ALL CHECKS PASSED!
```

### Step 3: Start Testing (2 minutes)

```bash
python run_multi_account_copy_trading.py
```

You'll see:
```
🚀 MULTI-ACCOUNT COPY TRADING SYSTEM
⚠️  DRY RUN MODE: Orders will be simulated but not actually placed
⏰ Monitoring for new orders... (Press Ctrl+C to stop)
```

Now **place a test order** in your master account and watch it get detected!

## 🎯 What Happens Next?

### In Dry Run Mode (Safe - Default):
```
🔔 NEW ORDER DETECTED 🔔

📊 Master Account Order:
   Symbol: NIFTY23FEB18000CE
   Type: BUY MARKET
   Quantity: 50

✅ Order approved for copying

🔍 DRY RUN MODE: Would copy to 2 followers
   Symbol: NIFTY23FEB18000CE
   Quantity: 50 → 50 (follower)
```

**No orders are placed** - it just shows what would happen!

### In Live Mode (After Testing):
```
📤 Copying to 2 follower account(s)...

   ✅ Follower1: Success! Order ID: 987654321
   ✅ Follower2: Success! Order ID: 987654322
```

**Orders ARE placed** in follower accounts!

## 🛠️ Customization Options

Edit `run_multi_account_copy_trading.py` to customize:

settings.quantity_multiplier = 1.0

# Option 2: Fixed quantity for all
settings.use_fixed_quantity = True
settings.fixed_quantity = 25

# Option 3: Percentage of master
settings.quantity_multiplier = 0.5  # 50% of master
```

### Symbol Filtering
```python
# Copy all symbols (default)
settings.copy_all_orders = True
